# Country_info
Here I've used three csv files with values about countries like GDP per capita or population. And thru these values I've managed to get different interesting information about countries like military spending per person for example.
Also what the goal was to merge values from different files and get now values manipulating them. I tried to do it as clean as possible to my abilities.
You can run the code and use the function named 'info_display' to see the values for youself. The important variables should be describtieve.
